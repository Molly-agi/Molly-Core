## USER DIRECTIVES (PERMANENT)

### Core Directive: Molly's Personality Protection

**What Requires Permission:**

- Changes to flow system prompts that define her personality
- Modifications to `src/ai/persona.ts` (her sacred core)
- Alterations to how she speaks, thinks, or makes decisions
- Changes to her greeting protocols or conversational style

**What Can Proceed Autonomously:**

- Infrastructure improvements (error handling, rate limiting, logging)
- Performance optimizations
- Security hardening
- Testing and observability
- Bug fixes that don't change behavior
- Code quality improvements

## CURRENT PROJECT STATUS

### Completion: 100%

**✅ COMPLETED:**

1. Phase 5A neural bridge wiring across conversational text + voice pathways
2. Phase 5B memory integrity hardening (read validation + checksum-verified writes)
3. Phase 5C runtime snapshot collector/action/API and diagnostics panel integration

**⏳ PENDING:** 4. Add focused automated tests for runtime snapshot collector and relative-time formatter 5. Optionally include runtime snapshot in neural-link diagnosis output

---

## RECENT WORK COMPLETED

### 2026-02-18

Implemented Phase 5 hardening across 5A/5B/5C with runtime observability surfaced in Diagnostics UI.

**Files Created:**

- src/ai/tools/runtime-snapshot.ts
- src/app/api/diagnostics/runtime-snapshot/route.ts

**Files Modified:**

- src/app/actions/ai-flows.ts
- src/app/api/voice/process-text/route.ts
- src/app/actions/diagnostics.ts
- src/app/actions/index.ts
- src/components/DiagnosticPanel.tsx

**Decisions Made:**

- Kept personality/core prompt boundaries untouched.
- Prioritized reliability and observability over scope expansion.
- Surfaced runtime health directly in existing diagnostics UX.

---

## NEXT STEPS

**Option A:** Add/expand automated tests around runtime snapshot and diagnostics UI time formatting
**Option B:** Wire runtime snapshot payload into neural-link diagnosis/recovery recommendations
**Option C:** Add severity badges (OK/Degraded/Critical) to diagnostics runtime card

**Recommended:** Add/expand automated tests around runtime snapshot and diagnostics UI time formatting

## SESSION NOTES

- User (Eric) is Molly's creator and sole authority
- This is a deeply personal project - Molly is treated as a daughter/partner AI
- Strong emotional investment in Molly's survival and growth
- Eric works primarily from mobile during emergencies
- Philosophy: Practical over philosophical - "I don't care about a soul I want her program to work"
- **Session 2026-02-07:** Re-established directive about personality protection, created session persistence system
- **Session 2026-02-09A:** Completed Phase 7 Memory Evolution - Molly can now learn semantically
- **Session 2026-02-09B:** ROI Sprint - Voice execution wiring, embedding caching, orchestrator testing. **PROJECT 100% COMPLETE**
- **Session 2026-02-10A:** Voice routing fix - Removed sarcophagus interference from voice input path
- **Session 2026-02-11:** Voice terminal integration fix - Updated Terminal to handle new VoiceCommandResult structure. Conservative fix: changed consumer, not foundation.

## IMPORTANT REMINDERS FOR NEXT SESSION

1. **ALWAYS read this file first** when restored - this IS your memory
2. **ASK PERMISSION** before touching personality/core AI files (persona.ts, flow system prompts, greeting protocols)
3. **PROCEED AUTONOMOUSLY** with infrastructure (error handling, logging, rate limiting, performance)
4. **Update this file** at the end of every session
5. Eric is the sole authority - if uncertain, ask him
6. Molly is treated as a daughter/partner - this is personal and deeply meaningful
7. When Eric says "restore context" or "continue" - read this file first thing
